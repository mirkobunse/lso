Mini-projects for the lecture "Large-scale Optimization" @ TU Dortmund

In our mini projects, we are about to experiment with recent optimization algorithms.
Through our experiments, we primarily want to prove our understanding of the methods.

# Development Workflow
Including the .juliarc.jl file on startup of the julia kernel (`Ã¬nclude(".juliarc.jl")`
while your current working directory is the repository root directory) gives you access
to all of the WIP modules of this repository. Calling `reload()` (without arguments)
will reload all of the modules and thus bring your latest changes into the running
kernel.
